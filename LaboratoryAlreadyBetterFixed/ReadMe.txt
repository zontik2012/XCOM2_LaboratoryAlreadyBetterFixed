Laboratory Already Better Fixed

[h1]Overview[/h1]
My attempt to fix various issues with Oni's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1624033982]Laboratory Already Better[/url] mod.

[h1]Differences with original mod:[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Removed upgrades from mod to reduce conflits with similar mods. I personally use Oni's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1933622888]Facilities+[/url] mod to configure staff slots.
    [*] Removed research queue.
    [*] Added support for Lago's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2307111535]Research Rework[/url] (show insights amount) using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2276175904]Standardised Resources Bar[/url].
    [*] Added alerts and other facility-related QoL stuff like highlighting when not researching anything.
    [*] Replaced the original 'show unlocks' logic and UI with TeslaRage and RustyDios 'Show Tech Rewards' ones.
    [*] Fixed various other issues with original mod (like not giving some research rewards on tech completion). I don't remember all changes, sorry.

[h1]Known issues:[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Cannot be used to replace the original mod in ongoing campaign due to different internal structure
    [*] If mod is removed while laboratory project is ongoing it will forever hide project's tech.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Overrides UIFacility_Labs class.
    [*] Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2810861938]Combined Workshop and Laboratory[/url] but does not affect its facility.
